  "summary": "Diff implements broad Arabic text localization in key UI components/pages, adds RTL document configuration (lang/dir) and basic RTL CSS adjustments, and localizes month names on Dashboard/Billing. It also includes unrelated styling/config changes (Tailwind/design tokens) and other non-localization refactors not explicitly requested.",

      "description": "Tailwind/design system configuration changes (custom color tokens/fonts/extended utilities) not required for Arabic localization/RTL.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asks for Arabic translation, RTL support, and Arabic month/date labels; it does not request a visual theme redesign or Tailwind configuration updates.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to UI localization/RTL and explicitly states non-goals include new business features; these code areas are not part of the listed AC files for translation and are not evidenced as required for RTL/Arabic text.",
