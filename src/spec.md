# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fully localize the accounting app frontend to Arabic and ensure the entire UI renders correctly in right-to-left (RTL) layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Translate all user-visible frontend UI strings to Arabic across authentication screens, navigation, Dashboard, Subscribers, Monthly Billing, dialogs, forms, tables, empty states, buttons, and toast notifications (sonner), focusing on the specified frontend files.
- Enable and validate RTL support for Arabic by setting appropriate document language/direction and ensuring key layouts (header/nav/sections/dialogs/forms/tables) align and flow correctly without overlap or clipping.
- Localize month names and date-context labels used in month/year selectors and billing/dashboard headings to Arabic.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays entirely in Arabic with RTL layout, including Arabic toast messages and Arabic month/date labels, with all pages and dialogs remaining readable and usable.
